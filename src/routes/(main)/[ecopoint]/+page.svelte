					<p>
						Ticino is wonderful. In autumn, winter and spring its cold and warm enough for
						bouldering, climbing, hiking, biking (even in summer one can climb in the shadow, if
						somewhat heat-resistant). It’s beautiful, and greatly developed in terms of public
						transport. There are lots of buses to the different valleys. Sometimes, while in front
						of the Gotthard tunnel cars are being stuck in traffic jams for hours, I race past it by
						train in peace and quiet (yes, all quiet – in Swiss trains you can mostly almost hear a
						needle drop…). Whenever I get out of the Gotthard, I’m blinded by the dazzling light,
						and then I see the lovely landscape, the green, wooded hills, the high mountains in the
						background – and I’m glad to be back here, and eager to go climbing. The famous Valle
						Maggia, close to Locarno, meanders deep into the mountains. For ecopoint climbing, it is
						perfect. There is a vast variety of different climbing styles and types – from slabs to
						steep overhangs and from trad to sport and multi-pitch climbing you can find almost
						everything – and almost everything is reachable by train and bus.
					</p>

					<section>
						<h2 class="h2">How to get there</h2>
						<p>
							From <strong>Zurich</strong> you travel by train to <strong>Bellinzona</strong>
							(depending on the connection via Arth-Goldau), then to <strong>Locarno</strong>, where
							you switch to the bus which takes you directly to <strong>Avegno</strong> in the Valle
							Maggia (travel time in total: 2:30 h).
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2 class="h2">Where to stay</h2>
						<p>
							If you stay at a campground, in a hotel or hostel taking part in the project “<a
								href="https://www.ticino.ch/en/ticket.html"
								target="_blank"
								rel="noopener">Ticino Ticket</a
							>”, you can use public transport for free.<br clear="none" />
							<br clear="none" />
							In
							<a href="https://www.camping-piccoloparadiso.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
								>Avegno</a
							>
							and
							<a
								href="https://www.tcs.ch/en/camping-travelling/camping-insider/campsites/tcs-campsites/campsite-gordevio-maggiatal.php"
								target="_blank"
								rel="noopener">Gordevio</a
							>
							for example, there are <strong>campgrounds</strong> from which you can even walk to
							different climbing crags (e.g. to Torbeccio in ca. 20 min., or to Ponte Brolla in ca.
							30 min., or take the bus to other crags in the valley). You have to look in detail on
							how long the travel time from your overnight stay to the different climbing areas will
							be.<br clear="none" />
							<br clear="none" />
							Unfortunately, the campgrounds in Ticino are closed in winter. But you could have a look
							at Airbnb or conventional holiday home websites (lots of conventional holiday accommodations
							take part in the Ticino Ticket Project) and find a place where to stay in Valle Maggia,
							Centovalli, Locarno, or Losone. You might find a beautiful old stone house =). Even if
							you only find an accommodation in Locarno, you can still quite easily go climbing in Valle
							Maggia (20 min. bus ride to Avegno, 45 min. to Cevio) or even in the Valle Onsernone (e.g.
							50 min. bus ride to Russo).
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2 class="h2">How to reach the crag(s)</h2>
						<p>
							If you stay somewhere between Locarno and the end of the Valle Maggia: The <a
								href="https://fartiamo.ch/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/62.315.pdf"
								target="_blank"
								rel="noopener">bus</a
							>
							from e.g. Locarno (and other stops on the line) leaves every 30 min. Depending on where
							you want to climb, the ride from Locarno takes between 20 min. (Avegno) to 60 min. (Linescio,
							switch bus in Cevio).<br clear="none" />
							<br clear="none" />
							For example, you can go to Ponte Brolla and climb in the east sector (sport climbing),
							where the routes are already quite polished, but still beautiful. The difficulties range
							between 5a to 8b. Just around the corner is the sector Castelliere with lots of easy multi-pitch
							climbing. Or you can go to Avegno, Torbeccio, a climbing crag with multi-pitches and three
							sport climbing sectors (6b-8b). You can also get on the bus to the Valle Maggia – which
							takes you to the different crags with all kinds of difficulties and styles, e.g. Someo,
							Cevio, Linescio and so on. The approach to the crags from the bus stops ranges between
							10 – 30 min.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2 class="h2">Tips</h2>
						<p>
							Beside the crags mentioned above, there are lots of other climbing crags in the area.
							And in addition, there are some <strong>boulder</strong> areas: directly in Avegno you
							can find great, but hard boulders in all difficulties; Brione is a famous boulder
							area, which you can reach from Locarno in 55 min (train to Tenero, then bus to Brione.
							Attention: Sometimes the bus can get quite crowded, so you might want to put your
							crashpad in the cargo space of the bus).<br clear="none" />
							<br clear="none" />
							<strong>Supermarkets</strong> can be found in Locarno (there is only a small kiosk by
							the train station) and in the villages Maggia and Cevio.<br clear="none" />
							<br clear="none" />
							For <strong>rest days</strong>, I recommend hiking or spending the day at the
							riverside of the Maggia. In Ponte Brolla, there are beautiful cliffs for cliff
							jumping, if you are keen on some adrenaline kick=). And if you enjoy strolling through
							the old villages, you will discover that every one of them is different from the
							others and tells us something about the long history of people living in remote places
							under harsh conditions in winter and great heat in summer, tending sheep, cows, and
							goats on steep slopes, living on subsistence farming.<br clear="none" />
							<br clear="none" />
							<strong>Attention</strong>: Sometimes, when the weather is bad in the north of the
							alps or when it’s a holiday weekend, trains and buses can get pretty crowded. So, you
							might want to plan your train/bus ride at times of lower rush (off-peak hours).

						<h2 class="h2">How to book the trip</h2>
						<p>
							<strong>From Switzerland</strong>: You can book the trip via the
							<a href="https://www.sbb.ch/en/home.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
								>SBB website</a
							>. It might be useful to download the SBB-App (you can pay by credit card), which
							might be handier than the website. In buses, you have to pay in cash.<br
								clear="none"
							/>
							<br clear="none" />
							<strong>From Germany</strong>: You can book your trip to Locarno via the
							<a href="https://www.bahn.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DB website</a>
							or App. You can have a look at the Austrian train website (<a
								href="https://shop.oebbtickets.at/en/ticket"
								target="_blank"
								rel="noopener">ÖBB</a
							>) and check a combination of DB and ÖBB tickets to get a cheaper ticket. From Locarno
							to your destination, you can buy the ticket via the SBB website/App or at a vending
							machine in Locarno / from the bus driver.<br clear="none" />
							<br clear="none" />
							<strong>From Austria</strong>: You can book your trip on the
							<a href="https://shop.oebbtickets.at/en/ticket" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
								>ÖBB website</a
							>
							or App. If you plan in advance, there are often pretty cheap “Sparschiene”-tickets (e.g.
							trip to Locarno from Innsbruck/Bregenz: EUR 30.–). From Locarno to your destination, you
							can buy the ticket via the SBB website/App or at a vending machine in Locarno / from the
							bus driver.<br clear="none" />
							<br clear="none" />
							If you stay on a campground, in a hotel or hostel taking part in the project “<a
								href="https://www.ticino.ch/en/ticket.html"
								target="_blank"
								rel="noopener">Ticino Ticket</a
							>”, you can use public transport for free after arrival.<br clear="none" />
							<br clear="none" />
							If you plan to travel more often to/in Switzerland, you might want to buy a “<a
								href="https://www.sbb.ch/en/travelcards-and-tickets/railpasses/half-fare-travelcard.html"
								target="_blank"
								rel="noopener">Half Fare Travelcard</a
							>”, which costs CHF 185, but then cuts prices by half. Attention: Plan the purchase in
							advance – cf. registration/ identification process etc.
